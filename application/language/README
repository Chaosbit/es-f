languages.ini defines enabled languages and their order on screen.

For each language are 2 files required:

  <language>.php  and  images/<language>.png

The php file holds the string definitions and the png file is the flag image.

To start a new translation, just:

- Copy en.php and translate into your language
  ATTENTION: The file MUST be saved in UTF-8!

- Don't "htmlspecialchar" your translation, just type 
  '<text>' and NOT '&lt;text&gt;', escaping will be done automatic.
  line format (php array):
  'TextIdentifier' => 'translated text',
  'TextIdentifier' => 'html:translated text',     // will NOT be escaped,
                                                  // write real HTML!
  'TextIdentifier' => 'file:filename_to_include', // bigger texts are better
                                                  // editable in separate files

- add your language to languages.ini
