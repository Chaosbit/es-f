To keep informed by email, if any ensiper process is doing something cron job,
add the following line to your crontab (crontab -e):

0/5 * * * * /path/to/es-f/addon/mail/cron.sh [IGNORE_USER1 [IGNORE_USER2 ...]]

e.g. to check each 5 minutes

Please test this from a shell before.

Use the Parameter -debug to show the possible mail content.

Sometimes the script fails, if the used user can't find the php cli binary
because it is not in its path.

Only in this case please define in cron.sh the path to the php cli binary in line 4:

phpcli=/path/to/php

Define users as parameters, which should refreshed automatic!

Configure mail.ini as you like.
