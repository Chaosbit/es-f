Let's imagine the constellation, that you like to access es-f from:

1. Any computer, WITH the installed authentication of es-f
2. A specific computer WITHOUT the question for user and password (automatic login)
3. Any computer, WITH your own authentication method (e.g. Apaches mod_auth)

1. Default authentication

Nothing to do, this is the default method.

2. Automatic login

Define a set of ip, user and password combinations, which should logged in
automatic into es-f

find the following code in config.xml and maintain it with your data.

    <config type="array">
      <config name="IP"></config>
      <config name="User"></config>
      <config name="Password"></config>
    </config>

There can be many such arrays.

IP can here be
- a full qualified address like '192.168.1.1' OR
- a range like '192.168.1.*'
USER is your eBay/es-f account name
PASSWORD is your es-f password, NOT your eBay password!

Please keep in mind, NOT to overlap ip addresses/ranges, the algorithm gets
the first user, thats ip matches!

3. Other authentication method

This is a combination of the "Automatic login" with your own method.

- Ensure, the the access to your es-f installation is possible ONLY with your
  used authentication method, e.g. Apaches mod_auth.
- Login your account automatic from ANY ip address using method with the
  definition of 'IP' = '*.*.*.*'
