Let's imagine the constellation, that you like to access es-f from:

1. Any computer, WITH the installed authentication of es-f
2. A specific computer WITHOUT the question for user and password (automatic login)

1. Default authentication

Nothing to do, this is the default method.

2. Automatic login

Look at the index page for section "Auto login".

You will find there a link with a login token (...?lt=...), special for this computer!

If you open this link, you will be logged in automatic.

THIS link will work ONLY on this computer for this es-f installation!
