Each part of the system is implemented as a "module".

Each module can run without the others and implements a full logic.

For each module you have 5 possible program steps:

- config.php
--------------
Module specific configuration, all module configs are included

Typically enable the module here and provide the module configuration options
here.

- common.php
--------------
common.php will be loaded, if the module is enabled and no login required or
a valid user is logged in.

Typically you add your menu item here to the application.

If the module requires a other module, check here if it is installed/enabled.

- plugin.php
--------------
plugin.php will be loaded, if the module is enabled and no login required or
a valid user is logged in.

Here you can register functions for several plugin terms.

- functions.php
-----------------
Only the file for the selected module is included.

Define the functions for the module here.

- prepare.php
---------------
Only the file for the selected module is included.

Check here for valid user if required, if not, redirect to login!

Process here data changes, which will selected later by the process step.

If neccessary, your can redirect to an other module and/or action here.
(esf_Forward(...), esf_Redirect(...))

In case of module redirection, the "new" functions.php/prepare.php
will be processed. 

- process.php
---------------
Typically collect the data and prepare output.

If you need processing at specific steps, you can put your code into functions
<module>_header, <module>_content, <module>_footer

(For an example take a look at auction/process.php
The main processing is made in auction_content to work on the actual auction
data gattered via refresh plugin at "OutputContent".)

==============
Translations are located in language directory.
The system and the modules can easy translated into your prefered language.
Take a look at en.php as example for file layout.
